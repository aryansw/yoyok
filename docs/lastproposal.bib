  abstract   = {This article advocates the revival of coroutines as a convenient general control abstraction. After proposing a new classification of coroutines, we introduce the concept of full asymmetric coroutines and provide a precise definition for it through an operational semantics. We then demonstrate that full coroutines have an expressive power equivalent to one-shot continuations and one-shot delimited continuations. We also show that full asymmetric coroutines and one-shot delimited continuations have many similarities, and therefore present comparable benefits. Nevertheless, coroutines are easier implemented and understood, especially in the realm of procedural languages.},
